    <h6>Teriyaki Baked Salmon</h6>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons corn starch</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves -minced</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 (5 oz.) salmon fillets</li>
        <li>Optional: sesame seeds or sliced green onions for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, add the soy sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, corn starch, garlic, and pepper. Whisk until the sugar and corn starch is dissolved.</li>
        <li>Place the salmon in a sealable food storage bag. Add half of the soy sauce mixture to the bag. Seal the bag. Move the salmon around in the bag until it is well coated in sauce. Place the bag in the refrigerator to marinate for a minimum of 30 minutes, or up to 2 hours.*</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Place the salmon in the baking dish skin side down, if applicable (discard the used marinade). Cook for 12-15 minutes, until the salmon is flakey when pressed with a fork. The cooking time will depend on the thickness of the salmon fillets.</li>
        <li>As the salmon cooks, make the glaze. Add the remaining soy sauce mixture to a small sauce pot. Bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 3-4 minutes, until the sauce has reduced and thickened. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Brush the cooked salmon with the teriyaki glaze. Optional: Serve sprinkled with sesame seeds and green onions.</li>
    </ol>
